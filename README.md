# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this project as a way to familiartize myself with HTML, CSS, JS, and Git, while simultaneously creating a place where I could store my notes and key takeaways from the assigned prework. With this project I learned how to add structure, design, and interactivity to a webpage as well as use Git/GitHub for version control on a project.

## Usage

This website can be used as a reference guide for all of the information I learned about HTML, CSS, JS, and Git while going through the assigned prework for this bootcamp. If the DevTools console is opened with this application, it will generate a random topic that I can spend my time studying.
